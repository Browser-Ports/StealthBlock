# StealthBlock (WIP)

A WIP, soon to be, the first undetectable Adblocker that is backwards compatible with other filter lists, and will have many implementations

It will use
 - [tsurlfilter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter): for network blocking with the traditional filter lists and for cosmetic rule lists (combined with *AeroSandbox*)
 - [AeroSandbox](https://github.com/vortexdl/aero/tree/untested/AeroSandbox)
